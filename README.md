# EEG-analysis-start

Project Goal
This project is intended to learn the basics of EEG signal analysis using Python. 
I analyze a sample EEG file: noise filtering, feature extraction, and visualization of the results.

Tools
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: MNE, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Repository Contents
- `eeg_analysis.ipynb` – notebook with code and plots
- `data/` – sample EEG data
- `plots/` – plots generated from the notebook

Project Status
Learning project – in progress. Planned updates: analysis of more patients and basic comparative statistics.
